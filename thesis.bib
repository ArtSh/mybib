	tailored by a computer-controlled acousto-optic pulse shaper excite
	fluorescence from laser dye molecules in solution. Fluorescence and
	laser power are monitored, and the computer uses the experimental
	data and a genetic algorithm to optimize population transfer from
	ground to first excited state. Both efficiency (the ratio of excited
	state population to laser energy) and effectiveness (total excited

	are elliptically andultimately circularly polarized, has been suggested
	as auniversal source of RCPL and LCPL on a cosmic scale. The moreprevalent
	right-(REPL) and left-(LEPL) elliptically polarizedcomponents have
	never been investigated for similar capabilities.The present study,
	using a 212.8 nm laser beam to mimic thesynchtrotron radiation, explores
	the potential of REPL and LEPLin this context and finds a qualitative
	trend indicating thateach induces asymmetric photolysis in the same
	sense as RCPL andLCPL, but to a lesser degree.},

  abstract = {The simplest two-dimensional (2D) spectra show how excitation with
	one (variable) frequency affects the spectrum at all other frequencies,
	thus revealing the molecular connections between transitions. Femtosecond
	2D Fourier transform (2D FT) spectra are more flexible and share
	some of the remarkable properties of their conceptual parent, 2D
	FT nuclear magnetic resonance. When 2D FT spectra are experimentally
	separated into real absorptive and imaginary refractive parts, the
	time resolution and frequency resolution can both reach the uncertainty
	limit set for each resonance by the sample itself. Coherent four-level
	contributions to the signal provide new molecular phase information,
	such as relative signs of transition dipoles. The nonlinear response
	can be picked apart by selecting a single coherence pathway (e.g.,
	specifying the relative signs of energy level difference frequencies
	during different time intervals as in the photon echo). Because molecules
	are frozen on the femtosecond timescale, femtosecond 2D FT experiments
	can separate a distribution of instantaneous molecular environments
	and intramolecular geometries as inhomogeneous broadeningThis review
	provides an introduction to two-dimensional Fourier transform experiments
	exploiting second- and third-order vibrational and electronic nonlinearities.

	walk-off between the pump beam and the generated signal in the nonguided
	system and this shortens the nonlinear interaction length. The SRWS
	may be greatly enhanced in a hollow waveguide filled with a liquid
	of higher index of refraction than that of the waveguide cladding
	as the long interaction length is maintained for the whole length
	of the waveguide. The enhanced SRWS results in a considerable red-shifted
	frequency super-broadening of an intense optical pulse that passes
	through the waveguide, and which can be experimentally observed.},
